# Trello inspired üìù
This project was developed during a begginer **React** course from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/curso-online-react-js).

So, it's an application to take notes build with **React** framewrok, exploring the concepts of SPA - Single-Page Application. I called it "trello inspired" because reminds me of the original [Trello's](https://trello.com/pt-BR) ideia.
